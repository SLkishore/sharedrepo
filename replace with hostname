How to Use the Macro:
Press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor in Excel.
Go to Insert > Module to create a new module.
Copy and paste the above VBA code into the module.
Close the VBA editor.
Run the macro by pressing ALT + F8, selecting ReplaceIPWithHostname, and clicking Run.
Explanation:
wsFirewall refers to the sheet containing your firewall rules.
wsMapping refers to the sheet that contains the IP addresses and their corresponding hostnames.
The macro first creates a dictionary (key-value pairs) where each IP address from the mapping sheet is mapped to its corresponding hostname.
It then loops through the firewall rules sheet, specifically columns O and K.
If an IP address in the firewall rules matches one in the mapping sheet, it is replaced by the corresponding hostname.
Multiple IPs in a single cell are handled by splitting and rejoining the values based on semicolons.
Make sure to adjust the sheet names ("Firewall Rules" and "IP Mapping") to match the actual names of your sheets.
