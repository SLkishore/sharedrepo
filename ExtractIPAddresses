How to Use the Macro:
Press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor in Excel.
Go to Insert > Module to create a new module.
Copy and paste the above VBA code into the module.
Close the VBA editor.
Run the macro by pressing ALT + F8, selecting ExtractIPAddresses, and clicking Run.
Explanation:
The macro scans through all rows in the source sheet, specifically in columns O and K.
It looks for IPv4 addresses in these columns using a regular expression.
If it finds any, it copies them to a new sheet named "Extracted IPs".
The IP addresses in each cell are split by semicolons (;), allowing the macro to handle multiple addresses per cell.
This code will create a new sheet where all extracted IP addresses are listed.
